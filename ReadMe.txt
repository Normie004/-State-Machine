I have successfully completed lab 4 with all the functions required. In this lab I have used recursive functions like 'while'. I have stored my personalized fsm as a linked list. There is use of pointers in the code so as to create the above mentioned linked list structure. malloc was used to allocate the memory in each 'node' that points to the personalized state machine.

'0' and'1' prints the respective state of the current state.

'd' without mentioning state prints the list of deleted states or prints "Nothing deleted", otherwise deletes the mentioned state and stores it in garbage. 

'g' shows the list of deleted states and stored in the garbage.

'c_ _' changes the 0 or 1 (to be mentioned in the [1] index of command) state of the current state to the state mentioned in the [2] index of command.

an additional 'e' was added to end or exit the simState.
